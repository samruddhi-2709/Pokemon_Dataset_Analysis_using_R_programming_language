# Pokemon_Dataset_Analysis_using_R_programming_language

This project focuses on analyzing a Pokémon dataset using the R programming language. Pokémon is a popular franchise that features fictional creatures with various characteristics and abilities. The dataset used in this analysis contains information about different Pokémon species, their attributes, and battle statistics.

The main objective of this project is to explore and gain insights from the Pokémon dataset through data analysis and visualization. Conducting exploratory analysis to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset. This involves generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and exploring factors that influence Pokémon attributes. Utilizing statistical techniques to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

Technologies and Tools Used: R programming language, RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment), R packages, such as ggplot2,dplyr.

The project's outcomes can be valuable for Pokémon enthusiasts, game developers, and researchers interested in understanding the dynamics of Pokémon attributes and battling mechanics.
